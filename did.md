# Development History Log

## Project: Laravel APAR Application
**Start Date:** September 30, 2025
**Developer:** AI Assistant

### Actions Taken:

**2025-09-30 - Project Setup Phase**
1. **Project Analysis** - Analyzed requirements from prompt.md and instructions.md
   - Understood need for Laravel app with MySQL database (apar_app, prefix: apar_)
   - Identified two user roles: Reviewing Officer (Admin) and Reporting Officer
   - Analyzed complex APAR form structure from word.htm file
   - Determined form access permissions: Parts 3&4 (both), Part 5 (Reviewing only), Part B (Reporting only)

2. **Initial Planning** - Created comprehensive todo list with 12 main tasks
   - Planned normalized database approach with separate tables for forms, sections, and data
   - Decided on Laravel Breeze for built-in authentication
   - Planned simplified web version of complex Word document form
   - Set up project to use database records for "file" management instead of physical files

### Next Steps:
- Create Laravel application in subdirectory
- Set up database configuration
- Install and configure authentication system

# Documentation of Implementation Decisions (did.md)

## 2024-09-30 - Laravel Setup Completed
- Created new Laravel project `apar_app` in subdirectory as per requirements.
- Used `composer create-project laravel/laravel apar_app` to scaffold the application.
- Configured .env for MySQL database connection (apar_app database).
- Installed Laravel Breeze with Livewire stack for authentication.
- Fixed MySQL string length issue by setting Schema::defaultStringLength(191) in AppServiceProvider.
- Successfully ran migrations for users, cache, and jobs tables.
- Authentication scaffolding is now ready with login/register functionality.

## Database Schema Implementation
- Created normalized database schema with 4 tables (all with `apar_` prefix):
  - `apar_forms`: Store form metadata (name, status, employee info)
  - `apar_roles`: Define user roles with JSON permissions
  - `apar_user_roles`: Many-to-many relationship between users and roles
  - `apar_form_data`: Store dynamic form field values by section
- Configured MySQL database with `apar_` table prefix as per requirements
- Created and ran seeders for roles and test users:
  - Reviewing Officer (reviewing.officer@tropmet.res.in / Admin@123) - Admin access
  - Reporting Officer (reporting.officer@tropmet.res.in / Iitm@123) - Limited access
- Created Eloquent models with proper relationships:
  - AparForm: Form management with dynamic data methods
  - AparRole: Role management with permission checking
  - AparFormData: Form field storage
  - Enhanced User model with role relationships

## Database Tables Created Successfully
All tables now have proper `apar_` prefix and are populated with test data.

## Controllers and Views Implementation
- Created `DashboardController` for main dashboard with role-based form listing

- Created dashboard view with:
  - User role information display
